            This attribute determines when a query is evaluated â€” after all records are read or each time

            first record is fetched. The driver reads all records, evaluates each one against the Where
            clause, and compiles a result set containing the records that satisfy the search criteria.
            This process slows performance when the first record is fetched, but activity performed on
            the result set after this point is much faster, because the result set has already been

            If DeferQueryEvaluation=1 (the default), the driver evaluates the query each time a record
            is fetched, and stops reading through the records when it finds one that matches the search
            criteria. This setting avoids the slowdown while fetching the first record, but each fetch
            takes longer because of the evaluation taking place. The data you retrieve reflect the latest
            changes to the database; however, a result set is still generated if the query is a Union of

            open so that if another query uses one of these tables, the driver does not have to perform
